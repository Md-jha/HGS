									<h6>Pigment-Based Digital Printers</h6>
									<p>A digital textile printer prints directly from a computer file onto the fabric. It uses inkjet printheads and is used for smaller quantities or more detailed designs.</p>
									<h6>These are ideal for cotton and blended fabrics. Pigment printing does not require steaming or washing, making it suitable for compact factories.</h6
										<p>Suitable for: Bedsheets, kurtis, dupattas</p>
										<p>Used by: Units in Udhna and Sachin</p>
										<p>Example: HGS Blaze Pigment Printer</p>
										
									<h3>Sublimation Printers</h3>

									</p>
									
									<p>Used by: Saree printers and sportswear manufacturers</p>
									<p>Requires: Heat press or calendar machine</p>
									
									
									<h3>Industrial High-Speed Printers</h3>
									<p>

									</p>
									
									<p>Suitable for: Sarees, bedsheets, dress material</p>
									<p>Used by: Export units and large-scale dye houses</p>
									<p>Example: HGS Sapphire 64-head printer</p>


									<h3>How a Fabric Printing Machine Works</h3>
									<p>Most digital fabric printers in Surat follow a basic workflow:</p>
								   
								   <p>The digital design is prepared using software like Photoshop or CorelDRAW.</p>
								   <p>Fabric is pre-treated if needed and loaded onto the printer</p>
								   <p>Ink is applied using printheads (such as Ricoh Gen6).</p>
								   <p>Fabric passes through a dryer or heater for ink fixation.</p>
								   <p>In pigment and sublimation machines, fabric is ready to cut after drying</p>
								   <h3>Trusted Manufacturers in Surat</h3>
								   <p>Many machine dealers operate in Ring Road, Saroli, and Palsana. However, for long-term value and technical support, buying directly from a manufacturer is preferred.</p>

									<h2>Fabric Printing Machines in Delhi  </h2>
								</div>
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										Delhi has long been a center for textile manufacturing in India. From garment export hubs in Okhla to print units in Gandhi Nagar and Karol Bagh, the demand for fabric printing machines continues to grow. Whether you’re printing t-shirts, sarees, bedsheets, or banners, choosing the right textile printing machine is essential for consistent output, print quality, and long-term cost efficiency.
In this article, we’ll walk through the types of fabric printing machines, how they work, price expectations in Delhi, and a look at HGS Machines, one of the most active digital printer manufacturers in the region.

									</p>
									<h3>Types of Fabric Printing Machines Commonly Used in Delhi</h3>
									<h6>1. Digital Textile Printers</h6>
									<p>
										These machines print directly from a computer to fabric. They’re common in Delhi’s small to medium workshops, especially in areas producing customized or short-run orders like printed dupattas, t-shirts, and bed linen
									</p>
									<p>Best for: Cotton, silk, rayon, polyester blends</p>
									<p>Available from: Brands like HGS Machines (HueJet, Tejas)</p>
									
									<h6>2. Pigment-Based Digital Fabric Printers</h6>
									<p>Ideal for natural fabrics like cotton, these printers do not require steaming or washing after printing. That makes them suitable for compact units in places like Karol Bagh, Shahpur Jat, and Lajpat Nagar.</p>
									
										<p>Best for: Cotton kurtis, tote bags, table covers</p>
										<p>Highlight: Saves water and space</p>
										<p>Example: HGS Blaze Pigment Printer</p>
										
									<h3>3. Sublimation Printers</h3>
									<p>
										These printers use heat transfer to apply ink to polyester fabric. Often used for jerseys, flags, and uniforms, you’ll find these machines operating in Okhla and Nehru Place for sportswear and schoolwear production.
									</p>
								
									<p>Best for: Polyester-based fabrics</p>
									<p>Note: Requires transfer paper and heat press</p>
									
									
									<h3>4. Industrial Fabric Printing Machines (High-Speed / Multi-Head)</h3>
									<p>
										Used by large production houses, these machines print at high speed and volume. HGS Machines’ Sapphire Single-Pass Printer is one such option used for larger print runs
									
									<p>Best for: Curtain fabric, bed linen, garment exports</p>
									<p>Head Count: Up to 64 Ricoh Gen6 heads</p>
									<p>Used in: Larger factories in Delhi-NCR</p>
									<h3>How a Fabric Printing Machine Works</h3>
									<p>While the exact workflow varies depending on the machine, most digital fabric printers in Delhi follow this simple process:</p>
								   
								   <p>1. Design is prepared using a digital file (usually in TIFF or PSD format).</p>
								   <p>2. Fabric is loaded—pre-treated if required.</p>
								   <p>3. Ink is applied via printheads (e.g., Ricoh Gen6).</p>
								   <p>4. Drying or heat setting is done using built-in heaters or dryers</p>
								 
								   <p>Pigment printers allow direct-to-cotton printing, while sublimation printers require heat transfer.</p>
								  <h3>Where to Buy Fabric Printing Machines in Delhi</h3>
								  <p>There are two main routes:</p>
								  <h6>1. Local Dealers and Distributors</h6>
								  <p>You’ll find equipment suppliers in:</p>
	                              <p>Nehru Place: Technical support and parts</p
									  
									  <p>Gandhi Nagar: Market access and smaller units</p>
									  <p>Okhla Industrial Area: Equipment financing, installation</p>
									  <p>Karol Bagh and Lajpat Nagar: Pigment and sublimation users</p>
									  <h6>2. Direct from Manufacturer: HGS Machines</h6>
									  <p>HGS Machines is based in Delhi and manufactures:</p>
								     <p>HueJet Series – For digital and pigment printing</p>
									 <p>Blaze Pigment Printer – Good for cotton prints</p>
									 <p>Sapphire Series – High-speed single-pass printing</p>
